                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I consider myself a lifelong learner. At a young age, my parents ignited my desire for knowledge by
                    reading to me at bedtime and encouraging me to write my own stories.
                    I fantasized about attending college as a child, so when I had to drop out, due to finances, my
                    whole world ended. Little did I know, this was the best thing to ever happen to me.
                    During my gap year, I discovered Information Technology. I pursued an Associate's degree in Computer
                    Information Systems at Bunker Hill Community College and joined Hack Diversity's inaugral
                    cohort. Additionally, I interned at Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston
                    and HubSpot as a Help Desk Technician. While at HubSpot, I learned about software development and
                    grew passionate about improving the user experience. Subsequently, I enrolled in Resilient Coders, a
                    non-profit coding bootcamp for young people of color. Because of Resilient Coders, I am now a Software Developer at Hi Marley. On
                    the side, I write blog posts for   <a href="https://www.skillist.co/">Skillist</a>, sit on  <a href="https://hackdiversity.com/">Hack Diversity's</a> alumni board,
                    develop features for <a href="https://www.joindough.com/">Dough</a>, strategize for <a href="https://www.thegcodehouse.com/">G| Code House</a>, and study Computer Science at Boston University.
                    I'm involved in all these programs because I am dedicated to pursuing my education AND educating my
                    own community. I aim to transform my community and grant them access to financial equity through
                    technology.
